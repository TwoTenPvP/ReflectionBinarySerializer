Quick binary serializer that takes a class, extracts the supported fields and turns them into binary.

Also works the other way around. Built on reflection. Licenced under MIT. 

Originaly created for use in the MLAPI but it might be handy for quick things on it's own.

It's very simplistic. No options etc.

It's not built for speed or efficiency. Just very simplistic and easy to use.
